QUEST TEMPLATE AND SETTING VARIABLES
You can make quests inherit all the properties of previous quests by using the attribute template="questNameToInherit". An example is
<quest id="tier6_fetch_clear" template="tier2_fetch_clear">
</quest>

When extending quests, you can set any variable by name using
<variable name="varName" value="varValue" />

The variable can be used to overwrite any value attribute of any property specified within the quests.xml, allowing you to make templates for certain quest types and change them in just a few lines.

In order to apply those variables to properties in quests that use a base quest as a template, add a param1="varName" to each property you want to change in the quest template that you want the variable to overwrite.

For example here is how you'd set up a variable to overwrite the name_key property in a quest that extends from a base quest.

<quest name="myFirstQuest">
	<name_key="myFirstQuest_name" param1="QuestName" />
</quest>

<quest name="mySecondQuest">
	<variable name="QuestName" value="mySecondQuest_name" />
</quest>

You can overwite ANY properties with variables including actions and sequences, but note that not all actions and objectives have full variable support (in particular those that are written in shorthand rather than explicitly stating each property). For a detailed list of which actions and objectives have full variable support, check each one above for further details.

Note that quest rewards are NOT carried over to new quests and therefore variables don't work with them - you must specify a reward type for every quest that you want to have rewards for.
